Again it is important to note that for purposes of this document, the term emulator can be used interchangeably with any simulator capable of executing RTL or gate-level models, including software HDL simulators. These interconnects are provided in the form of message channels that run between the software side and the hardware side of the SCE-MI infrastructure. Each message channel has two ends. The end on the software side is called a message port proxy which is a C++ object that gives API access to the channel. The end on the hardware side is a message port macro that is instantiated inside a transactor and connected to other components in the transactor. Each message channel is.

It is important to note that message channels are not unidirectional or bidirectional busses in the sense of hardware signals, but are rather more like network sockets that use message passing protocols. It is the job of the transactors to serve as abstraction gaskets that decompose messages arriving on input channels from the software side into sequences of cycle accurate events that are to be clocked into the DUT. For the other direction of flow, transactors recompose sequences of events coming from the DUT back into messages to be sent via output channels to the software side.DUT C/C++ kernelUTC Model Software Side (host workstation) Hardware Side (emulator)SCE-MI InfrastructureMessage Port Proxy 3Transactor 2Transactor 1 Message Overall Description and Use Model Functional Requirements Specification: Standard Co-Emulation Modeling Interface (SCE-MI) 7 of 94In addition, the SCE-MI infrastructure provides clock (and reset) generation and shared clock control using handshake signals with the transactor. This allows the transactor to “freeze” controlled time while performing message composition and decomposition operations.

The identification of high-level goals is funda mental to requirements analysis specification process. This can be achieved by asking 'why' questions about the operational descriptions of the system available. Goals are important in the requirements engineering process because they bring completeness and ease of readability to the requirements.

Additionally, they suppor t trade-offs amongs t design alternatives. Based on the utility of goals and scenarios, there is a need to develop a tool, which will assist analysts in the scenario and goal mining, reconciliation and manage ment processes. The tool aims to maintain a goal and scenario repository for use in continuing analyses of policies and other documents from which goals and scenarios can be derived. All goals are fully traceable to the policies in which they are stated and are distinguished as.

Based on the utility of goals and scenarios, there is a need to develop a tool, which will policy goals (strategic goals) or scenario goals (tactical goals) in each policy. This tool will provide strong management, which will offer flexible user defined conditions (like ID, keywords, taxonom y, subject, actor, and occurrences). The tool will also suppor t automatic multi-user analysis results comparison. For example, each analyst can classify goals separately and the tool can automatically check the differences in their classification results for their resolution. Requirements engineers, Chief Privacy Officers (CPO), policy analysts or auditors will be able to use this tool. This document specifies the services that the tool will provide and the constraints under which the system must operate. It contains the following sections: Description of Modules: This section contains a detailed description of the contents of each module. FR: Functional Requirements: This section specifies the operational services that the tool will provide to its users. NFR: Non-Functional Requirements: This section specifies the properties like accuracy, performance etc. that the tool must satisfy.

  - `2.0.1`: In version 2.0, GLib has picked up the type system which forms the foundation for GTK's class hierarc hy, the sign al system which is used throughout GTK, a th read API whic h abstracts the diffe rent native thread APIs of the various platforms and a facility fo r loading modules. As the last component , GTK uses the Pango library for internationalized text output. 3. General GUI Porting Approach The Watcom GUI library depends on the Watcom Progra mming Interface (WPI) a nd Memory Trac ker (TrMem ) libraries. WPI is explicitl y designed to port Windows fun ctionality to OS/2 Presen tation Manager (not the other way arou nd). Both Windo ws and OS/2 APIs h ave similar an d compatible designs to a larg e extent. GTK API is sim ilar n.

Ho wever takin g into accoun t that the Watco m GUI lib rary activ ely u ses WPI calls it see ms reason able to port most of the WPI functions called in the library. Since th e GUI library relies on OS/2 PM and Windows API, it uses predefined types that ex ist on ly in these.

The second file, loadelf2.c, contains only the routine s for creating E LF The m ain function is FiniELFLo adFile() . The fo llowing tasks are performed there: 1. Initialize th e ELF header, program headers,.
  - `2.3.2.2`: 2.3.2 De scription section headers. 2. Write groups (i.e. code.
  - `2.3.2.3`: 2.3.2 De scription data) to the EL F file (program.
  - `2.3.2.4`: 2.3.2 De scription section headers are changed during this pro cess; i.e. section s: .text, .data,.
  - `2.3.2.5`: 2.3.2 De scription .bss). 3. Write rel ocation section (.rela.text). 4. Write DWARF debug information (if need ed). 5. Write symbol table (.symt ab), hash (.hash),.
  - `2.3.2.6`: 2.3.2 De scription strings (.strtab). 6. Write section strings (.shstrtab). 7. Write section headers . 8. Write DWARF trailer (i f needed ). 9. Rewind.
  - `2.3.2.7`: 2.3.2 De scription write th e ELF header.
  - `2.3.2.8`: 2.3.2 De scription progra m headers. Task 1 is performed in void SetHeaders( ElfHdr *hdr ). Sectio ns are i nitialized in void InitSectio ns( ElfHdr is defined as: $OWROOT/bld/wl/h/loadelf2.h stringtable secstrtab; int secstr; // Index of strings section for section names int grpbase; // Index base for Groups in section int grpnum; // Number of groups int relbase; // Index base for relocation sections SciTech Softwar e, Inc.

This stru cture is filled in InitSectio ns(). So the order of sections is predefi ned. Program heade r is created i n SetHe aders() as well. Task 2 is performed in void WriteELFGr oups ( ElfHdr *hdr ). In this function, group list is iterated (as described in WLCo re). For each group, code or data are written to the ELF file, using WriteGroupLoad() . The corresp onding program headers.
  - `2.3.2.9`: 2.3.2 De scription sectio ns are filled as well, using SetGroupHeaders (). Note that uninitialized data ( .bss) are proces sed in t he special way. Relo catio ns are written using void WriteRelocsSecti ons( ElfHdr *hdr ). In this im plementation, all relocation s are presented with explicit add ends (i.e. SHT _RELA ). Task 5 is performed by WriteElfSy mTable( ElfSymTa ble *tab, ElfH dr *hdr , int hashidx , int symt abidx, int strtabidx ). Both symbol table.
  - `2.3.2.10`: 2.3.2 De scription hash are written in this function. Then string table is written using WriteSHString s(). Function WriteSHString s() is reu sed for th e next task (i.e. writing section n ames). Note t hat field curr_off (from ElfHdr ) is widely used. This field specifies the curre nt offset in the ELF file. Howev er, it is n ot updated automatically, e.g. after WriteLoad() therefore precise calculations a re needed to keep this value up to date. Functions to write ELF (and oth er) executable files are lo cated in $OWROOT/bld/wl/c/ loadfile.c .

Multiple driver communications within the same train A term used to describe communications between the drivers of each active cab in a train comprising multiple traction vehicles. The part of the functional identity of a user which defines the functional role performed by the user on a specific train, engine or coach. Operational communications These are railway communications directly concerned with train.
  - `REQ-92.2`: Initiator may shunting movements or train operation. For example, controller-driver communications. A handheld radio suitable for use by people involved in railway operations (eg shunting team members). Power supply controller A controller responsible for the management of the traction power supply. The location.
  - `REQ-92.3`: Initiator may direction of movement of any particular train permits the unique identification of a Primary Controller. The Primary Controller is currently the co-ordinator of train emergency calls. The Primary Controller is normally responsible for the operation of a designated area of track. The exact responsibilities of the Primary Controller are determined on a national basis. Public emergency call A point-to-point voice call which is used to notify non-railway authorities (such as Police.

  - `REQ-92.6`: Initiator may other concerned personnel of a level of danger requiring all Railways movements in a pre-defined area to stop. Two types of Railway emergency calls are defined: - Train emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst not involved in Shunting operations); - Shunting emergency calls (for Railway emergencies whilst involved in Shunting operations). The use of a mobile on any communications network other than the user’s home A Secondary Controller is a train controller who holds responsibility for the safe running of trains on a designated area of track (e.g. a signaller). Secondary Controllers require the facility to communicate with trains in all situations in order to perform their function. The split of responsibilities between Primary Controllers.
  - `REQ-92.7`: Initiator may Secondary Controllers is determined on a national basis. A group of people manoeuvring trains in order to change their location or composition. Communications for shunting are particularly critical when a driver at the front of a train is pushing it backwards towards buffers or other potential obstructions.

Summing up the document handling of different countries, in most countries the management of documents that bear legal validity falls into the general arena of public documents handling - that means: outside the pure procurement context. France follows a two step approach: the Economic Operator first sends his offer and the self- declarations (no bankruptcy, no conviction, compliance with employment obligations, etc.); the second sub-step concerns only the contractor and consists in sending social and fiscal attestations and, if necessary, the copy of the decisio n of the judicial procedure. Italy adopts the “DirectAccess” to documents and information records managed by public administrations. This solution removes from t he Economic Operator the duty and burden to get and submit these specific attestations.

Speci/f_ically, Hanzo plan to involve IIPC member institutions to work on creating and/or reviewing requirements during the inception phase of the project, which includes a questionnaire prepared by BnF. During the transition phase, when working towards project closure, IIPC member institutions are invited to collaborate on acceptance testing of the tools within their “real world” settings; involving deployment of the tools and applications within participating institutions. Participating institutions are:Denmark (Netarchive.dk) — will contribute at the testing level, will use a copy of some of their data as test data. Happy with the speci/f_ication to date, but wish to be kept informed of changes and developments.Norway (NL) — will contribute through testing and collaborating, based on their own plans to convert their web-archive to WARC (approximately 2,000,000,000 URLs).UK (BL) — will contribute both at the requirement speci/f_ication and testing stages of the project, possibly using their selective archive as test data.France (BnF) — will contribute at speci/f_ication stage and at testing stage also. Will provide ARC /f_iles as test data. Will facilitate circulation and sharing of all useful information between this project and other ongoing relevant work on WARC usage run by the IIPC Preservation WG and the IIPC Technical Committee.Sweden (NL) — form of contribution to be con/f_irmed.New Zealand — will contribute in the speci/f_ication and the migration process.This approach will ensure the community will have /f_irst-hand use and knowledge of the tools in their real-life environment, serving as further acceptance and veri/f_ication of the toolset as a whole.This Functional Requirements Speci/f_ications (FRS) is a base-line statement of functional requirements for the project as a whole, including high-level estimates of effort and schedule, based on the above approach and assumptions and best-practice estimation. Following review of the FRS and questionnaire additional estimation and scoping exercises will be carried out to ensure the project remains within the base-line scope. Any institutional requirements that cause the project to exceed this scope will be /f_lagged and the institution may.

  - `0.424.1`: FR 6 — The migration work/f_low shall be able to call external tools and services (e.g., database queries, shell commands, web service).The migration tool will permit use of external tools or services to generate preservation and migration metadata to be stored in the WARC records. As such the arc2warc command will become one out of several processes to be used for migration. Examples of external tools and services are:•tools to create persistent identi/f_iers for WARC-record-ID•/f_ile identi/f_ication services (DROID, FILE, JHOVE) to ascertain the format of a /f_ile and write it as WARC-identi/f_ied-payload. •tools to scan /f_iles for malware and viruses and identify them as such in the WARC /f_ileFR 7 — The migration process shall use persistent, opaque, unique, and global identi/f_iers for records access.For example:•Noid: http://search.cpan.org/~jak/Noid-0.424•ARK: http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/ark•UUID: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identi/f_ierFR 8 — A (default) external tool (e.g., ClamAV) will be used to scan /f_iles before conversion (pre-conversion step).FR 9 — The API should be /f_lexible enough to allow external tools such as JHOVE, DROID to be used for /f_ile format identi/f_ication.Such external tools or services will be identi/f_ied in the strategy con/f_iguration /f_ile. The manager should be able to follow the progress of a migration process (eg.,number of migrated records//f_iles, time spent and time remaining, etc.), whether it is running on one machine or is distributed across machines.FR 10 — The ARC to WARC migration should be able to run on multiple machines that will be easy to deploy. This may be achieved by using a simple messaging infrastructure.FR 11 —Logging during the migration may be turned on/off at any time .FR 12 — Software checkpoints (such as start-trans, end-trans) may be added during processing for managing atomic transactions (e.g., operations on a /f_ile, these must start and complete to be accepted in the migration), except where operating system limitations would prohibit it. Note that it should be possible to avoid having to specify any network code or learn a foreign API, which accounts for considerable complexity, for example, in map-reduce solutions (e.g., Hadoop, Google Map/Reduce). The process migration will take care of these issues at runtime. To start more clients in parallel, this code would be called multiple times from.
  - `0.424.2`: FR 6 — The migration work/f_low shall the local machine or any machine on the local network, causing more clients to begin processing the server data concurrently. This will form the parallel arc2warc conversion strategy used in WARC Tools Phase III.FR 13 — It shall be possible to perform a “dry-run migration”. That is, a blank conversion to generate useful reports (performance issues, bad ARCs, time estimation ...) without writing real WARC data (i.e. simulating only). Dry run is de/f_ined entirely by the con/f_iguration. WARC Tools Phase III Functional Requirements Speci/f_ication 5.

## Recommendations

### For Requirements Authors

1. **Avoid Vague Comparatives:** Replace words like 'better', 'faster', 'best' with specific, measurable criteria
2. **One Requirement Per Statement:** Split compound requirements using 'and', 'or' into separate, testable requirements
3. **Use Quantifiable Metrics:** Include specific numbers, timeframes, and thresholds
4. **Be Specific:** Define exact performance criteria rather than relative terms
5. **Make Requirements Testable:** Each requirement should have clear pass/fail criteria

### Best Practices

- ❌ Bad: 'The system shall provide the best performance'
- ✅ Good: 'The system shall respond to user queries within 500ms'

- ❌ Bad: 'The system shall validate and store user input'
- ✅ Good: Split into two requirements:
  - 'The system shall validate user input'
  - 'The system shall store validated user input'

## Conclusion

This analysis identified 1685 problematic requirements out of 20951 total requirements (8.0% issue rate).

The low issue rate suggests generally good requirement quality, with some areas for refinement.
